# The functionalities of my project is that the user can experience the 3d models that the user can experience without having the models.
# I have provided some models to the user to experience the augmented reality
# I have used flutter for designing the app and for authentication i have used the firebase for my project.
# I have used the unity to make the ar models and assets for the project and i have provided you the augmentedrealityproject in which you can see the project assets.
# user credentials for authentication:
1)username : vivek
gmail : sai7831@gmail.com
password : 123456

2)username : raghu

# I have tried to make this as one app but the unity file is very large to load as an single app so i have decided to make two apps one for the verification of the authentication so and the other provides the augmented reality in which users can use the 3d models to experience ar models.
# So for checking the security purpose of the project i have provided the apk named app-release so that you can test it.
# For contact purpose you can mail to me : goguladinne22bcy28@gmail.com mail.For any queries i will respond to the doubts that you have.
# For experiencing the augmented reality i have added another apk in the augmentedrealityproject file in build there will be an Finalfurniture apk so that you can experience the augmented reality.
