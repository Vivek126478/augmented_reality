# The functionalities of my project is that the user can experience the 3d models that the user can experience without having the models.
# I have provided some models to the user to experience the augmented reality
# I have used flutter for designing the app and for authentication i have used the firebase for my project.
# I have used unity for my backend application and i have generated an apk from that which i will be sending to you.
# user credentials for authentication:
username : vivek
gmail : sai7831@gmail.com
password : 123456

2)username : raghu 
gmail : raghu12@gmail.com

# I have tried to make this as one app but the unity file is very large to load as an single app so i have decided to make two apps one for the verification of the authentication so and the other provides the augmented reality in which users can use the 3d models to experience ar models.
